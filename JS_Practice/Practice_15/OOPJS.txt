# Prototypes in JS:

    -> A JavaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method).

    -> JS objects have a special by default property called "Prototype", which is a reference to an object.

    -> This "Prototype" also has some properties and behavior.

    -> We can set prototype using __proto__

    -> The type of "Prototype" is a reference to an object (can be null too).

    -> *If object & prototype have same method, object's method will be used.


# Classes in JS:

    -> Class is a program-code template for creating objects.

    -> Those objects will have some state(variables) & some behavior (functions) inside it.

    -> These objects are of types of their respective classes.

    -> All attributes and behaviors of the class will be in object inside the prototype.


# constructor in JS:

    -> constructor() method is:
        ~ automatically invoked by new
        ~ initializes the object

    -> eg:
            class MyClass {
                constructor() {....}
                myMethod() {....}
            }

    -> the "new" keyword searches for the constructor inside the class but if it doesn't find any, it automatically creates one for the class.

    -> the objects are helpful when it comes to initializing the object.
