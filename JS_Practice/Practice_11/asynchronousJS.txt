=> Sync in JS :-

    # Synchronous:

        -> Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program.

        -> Each Instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.


    # Asynchronous:

        -> Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI.

        -> Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instruction immediately and doesn't block the flow.



=> Callbacks:

    A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

    # Callback Hell:

        -> Callback Hell : Nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. (Pyramid of Doom)

        -> This style of programming becomes difficult to understand & manage.



=> Promises:

    -> Promise is for "eventual" completion of task. It is an object in JS.

    -> It is a solution to callback Hell.

    eg: 
        let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{.....});
                                      |_______|
                                          |
                                function with 2 handlers


    * resolve & reject are callbacks provided by JS *

    -> The promises have 3 states:

        (1) pending - the result is undefined

        (2) fulfilled(resolved) - the result is a value(fulfilled)   resolve(result)

        (3) rejected - the result is an error object   reject(error)



    -> How Promises are used??

        # .then()  &  .catch()

            (1) promise.then((res) => {....})  //executes only when the promise is "fulfilled".

            (2) promise.catch((err) => {....})  //executes only when the promise is "rejected".

        # We do promise chaining using ".then" & ".catch" to counter "Callback Hell".


=> Async-Await:

    -> async fucntion always returns a promise.

        eg:  async function myFunc(){....}

    -> await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled.
