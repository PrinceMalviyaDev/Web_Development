# Prototypes in JS:

    -> A JavaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method).

    -> JS objects have a special by default property called "Prototype".
    
    -> In JavaScript, a prototype is an object that is automatically associated with every function and object. It acts as a mechanism for inheritance, allowing objects to access properties and methods that are not directly defined on them.

    -> We can set prototype using __proto__

    -> The type of "Prototype" can either be a reference to another object or it can be null.

    -> *If object & prototype have same method, object's method will be used.


# Classes in JS:

    -> Class is a program-code template for creating objects.

    -> Those objects will have some state(variables) & some behavior (functions) inside it.

    -> These objects are of types of their respective classes.

    -> All attributes and behaviors of the class will be in object inside the prototype.


# constructor in JS:

    -> constructor() method is:
        ~ automatically invoked by new
        ~ initializes the object

    -> eg:
            class MyClass {
                constructor() {....}
                myMethod() {....}
            }

    -> the "new" keyword searches for the constructor inside the class but if it doesn't find any, it automatically creates one for the class.

    -> the objects are helpful when it comes to initializing the object.


# super Keyword:

    -> The super keyword is used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parent's properties and methods.

    -> eg:
            super(args);  //calls Parent's constructor

            super.parentMethod(args);


# Getters & Setters: 
    
    Getters and Setters are special methods that allow you to access and update object properties in a controlled way.

    (Q) Why do we need them??

    Ans : To control how a value is accessed or changed.
          To validate data before storing it.
          To create computed properties.
          To make code more clean and encapsulated.

    => Getters:
        
        -> A getter is used to read a property’s value.
        -> It looks like a property, but it runs a function.

        -> Benefit: The value is read like a normal property, but behind the scenes, logic runs.

    => Setters: 

        -> A setter is used to modify a property’s value, with validation if needed.

        -> Benefit: Calls the setter function internally, but looks like a simple assignment.

    Getters allow controlled reading of object properties, and setters allow controlled updating of properties. They provide encapsulation while still using a clean property-like syntax.
