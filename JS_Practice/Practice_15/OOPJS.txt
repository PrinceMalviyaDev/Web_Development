# Prototypes in JS:

    -> A JavaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method).

    -> JS objects have a special by default property called "Prototype", which is a reference to an object.

    -> This "Prototype" also has some properties and behavior.

    -> We can set prototype using __proto__

    -> The type of "Prototype" is a reference to an object (can be null too).

    -> *If object & prototype have same method, object's method will be used.
