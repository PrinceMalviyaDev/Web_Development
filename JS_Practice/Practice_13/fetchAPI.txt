# API (Application Programming Interface):

    -> API is like a system or a server or a website created by someone else, and we can "Request" some data from it and in return the API sends us the "Response".

    -> The APIs work on Request<-->Response cycle.


# Fetch API

    -> The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching(sending/receiving) resources.

    -> It uses Request and Response objects.

    -> The fetch() method is used to fetch a resource(data).

    eg: 
        let promise = fetch(url, [options]);

    -> Using "Fetch API" simply means using JS's fetch() method.

    -> Whe we don't pass any option in fetch() method, then the fetch method creates a particular type of request called "GET"

    -> The soul purpous of GET request is to get(return) some data from somewhere(API or Server).


# Understanding Terms:

    -> AJAX is Asynchronous JavaScript and XML  (used in older web apps, data was sent in XML Format).

    -> JSON is JavaScript Object Notation (AJAJ : Asynchronous JavaScript and JSON)

    -> json() method: returns a second promise that resolves with the result of parsing the response body text as JSON. (Input is JSON, output is JS Object). It is also an Asynchronous method.


# Data Format conversion:

    -> Whenever we send a request to API, we get some Response which is in JSON format, we need to convert this into "JS Object" format.


# Request & Response:

    -> HTTP Verbs: verbs are basically the method by which we are sending or receiving the data, they can be GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE, PATCH.

    -> Response Status Codes:  

        (1) Informational responses ( 100 - 199 )
        (2) Successful responses ( 200 - 299 )
        (3) Redirection messages ( 300 - 399 )
        (4) Client erro responses ( 400 - 499 )
        (5) Server error responses ( 500 - 599 )

    -> HTTP response headers also contain details about the responses, such as content type, HTTP status code etc.
